 HUN_proclaim_greater_hungary:0 "Proclaim Greater Hungary"
 HUN_proclaim_greater_hungary_desc:0 "We have regained control of the majority-Hungarian lands that were taken from us at Trianon. Although we have not achieved the heights of Historic Hungary, we have nonetheless achieved a Greater Hungary."
 HUN_strengthen_the_aristocracy:0 "Strengthen the Aristocracy"
 HUN_strengthen_the_aristocracy_desc:0 "No matter what the opposition might claim, what Hungary needs right now is calm, stability, and order. We must not give in to radical demands, and should instead increase the powers of the House of Magnates and of the regent."
 HUN_thedeathofgyulagombos:0 "Replacing $HUN_gyula_gombos_de_jakfa$"
 HUN_thedeathofgyulagombos_desc:0 "$HUN_gyula_gombos_de_jakfa$ has served Hungary faithfully for many years, but he will not be able to win his fight with cancer. Whomever we appoint to replace him will have to be very exceptional."
 HUN_appointzoltantildy:0 "Appoint $HUN_tibor_eckhardt$"
 HUN_appointzoltantildy_desc:0 "$HUN_tibor_eckhardt$ is the leader of the $HUN_smallholders_party_long$, which is rapidly growing in influence. Their programme includes land reform and expanding suffrage, which will be unpopular among the aristocracy, but we will need the support of the common people in the times to come."
 HUN_restoreistvanbethlen:0 "Reappoint $HUN_istvan_bethlen$"
 HUN_restoreistvanbethlen_desc:0 "$HUN_istvan_bethlen$ was the former Prime Minister, but his liberal policies were unpopular during the ruinous Great Depression. Now that the economy has recovered, having an Anglophile liberal as our Prime Minister could make us a powerful ally."
 HUN_appointkalmandaranyi:0 "Appoint $HUN_kalman_daranyi$"
 HUN_appointkalmandaranyi_desc:0 "$HUN_gyula_gombos_de_jakfa$ was a conservative, and who better to follow in his footsteps than another conservative? Kálmán Darányi opposes both leftist and rightist radicals, and his pragmatism ensures that we will have many opportunities to strengthen our ties with the great powers."
 HUN_revise_the_bethlenpeyer_pact:0 "Revise the Bethlen-Peyer Pact"
 HUN_revise_the_bethlenpeyer_pact_desc:0 "The Bethlen-Peyer Pact was an agreement signed by István Bethlen and Károly Peyer, which greatly limited the influence of the $HUN_democratic_party_long$ in exchange for the government turning a blind eye to union activities. The pact is very unpopular among the left, and revising it to allow for greater participation of the $HUN_democratic_party$ in politics could give us some leftist support."
 HUN_protect_the_trade_unions:0 "Compromise With the Trade Unions"
 HUN_protect_the_trade_unions_desc:0 "Although we do not actively oppose the trade unions, it is obvious that we are not allies. By empowering them to defend workers in light industry, while retaining control of heavy industry, we may be able to find a compromise that is acceptable to us both."
 HUN_marginalise_the_fascists:0 "Marginalise the Fascists"
 HUN_marginalise_the_fascists_desc:0 "We are conservatives, not radicals. We want to protect the Hungarian way of life and restore its greatness, not destroy everything we have built thus far and plunge the country into war. We must stamp out this disgusting movement before the fascists can seize power and ruin the Hungary we have worked so hard to create."
 HUN_secret_ballot:0 "Electoral Reform"
 HUN_secret_ballot_desc:0 "The current open ballot system can lead to voter manipulation and intimidation, which is impermissible in a modern political system. We should institute a secret ballot to encourage political participation and to strengthen the common people over the elite."
 HUN_restrict_feudal_privileges:0 "Restrict Feudal Privileges"
 HUN_restrict_feudal_privileges_desc:0 "The Hungarian nobility retains the titles and privileges of a bygone era, which means that the common people are still inferior to the aristocracy. Even if we cannot take away their lands, we must at least limit their political influence for the sake of the greater good."
 HUN_mission_to_the_us:0 "Mission to [USA.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_mission_to_the_us_desc:0 "It would be in our best interest to send $HUN_tibor_eckhardt$ to [USA.GetNameDef] in order to build ties between our two nations. The American-Hungarian Federation could support us from abroad and American expertise will be vital in the years to come."
 HUN_british_industrial_aid:0 "British Industrial Aid"
 HUN_british_industrial_aid_desc:0 "When Hungary was still recovering from the Great War, it was ironically the British who first came to our aid and helped us rebuild. We have not forgotten this, and now we have the resources to negotiate for industrial aid on more equal terms."
 HUN_restore_the_free_market:0 "Restore the Free Market"
 HUN_restore_the_free_market_desc:0 "The Hungarian government exercises a great amount of intervention in the economy. Though some of this can be traced back to Bethlen's consolidation policies, the Great Depression has largely ended and foreign investment could be the solution to our budget and monetary problems."
 HUN_suffrage_reform:0 "Limit Suffrage Rights"
 HUN_suffrage_reform_desc:0 "There are too many dangerous elements in Hungary, and their influence is growing. We must stop them at the polls so that they cannot influence our government, regardless of what the opposition thinks of our actions."
 HUN_support_italian_interests:0 "Draw Closer to [ITA.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_support_italian_interests_desc:0 "Italy has been our single greatest ally ever since the end of the Great War - not even Germany wishes to back some of our land claims. We should therefore strengthen our ties to Italy, in the hopes of establishing a true alliance in the future."
 HUN_the_march_front:0 "The Hungarian Tragedy"
 HUN_the_march_front_desc:0 "We are being drawn into a conflict without equal, yet many Hungarians applaud our imminent demise. We cannot stand for [GER.GetAdjective] domination - we must strike out, even if alone, and stand with the free world."
 HUN_the_trianon_trauma:0 "The Trianon Trauma"
 HUN_the_trianon_trauma_desc:0 "Some of us have family in Slovakia, others have lost their ancestral lands in Transylvania, and all of us regard foreign powers with fear given our army restrictions. Though we are too weak to challenge our neighbours alone, we should still circumvent the Treaty of Trianon where possible and seek allies so that we may end the injustice forced upon us."
 HUN_renounce_the_treaty_of_trianon:0 "Return Everything!"
 HUN_renounce_the_treaty_of_trianon_desc:0 "The injustice forced upon our nation at the end of the Great War, ripping away two-thirds of our once-great nation's territory and population, rivals that of the disgrace visited upon Germany in the Treaty of Versailles, and it must be undone."
 HUN_maintain_nonbelligerence:0 "Maintain Non-belligerence"
 HUN_maintain_nonbelligerence_desc:0 "Though war is at our doorstep, we must not take part unless we are forced to do so. Hungary has already been devastated once; it must not happen again."
 HUN_territorial_autonomy:0 "Territorial Autonomy"
 HUN_territorial_autonomy_desc:0 "When we seized Carpathia, we promised the inhabitants that they would have territorial autonomy. We are now in a position to make good on our promise, and perhaps make the same concession to other regions for the sake of stability."
 HUN_continue_the_regency:0 "Continue the Regency"
 HUN_continue_the_regency_desc:0 "Although Hungary is technically a kingdom, there is no need for a king at this moment. Horthy has led us for a decade, and we should have faith in his leadership for the coming years."
 HUN_treaty_of_eternal_friendship:0 "Treaty of Eternal Friendship"
 HUN_treaty_of_eternal_friendship_desc:0 "In exchange for dropping our claims, we and the [YUG.GetAdjective]s would commit to protect each other from foreign invasion. This will likely be very unpopular, but we lack allies and have few other options."
 HUN_poleandhungariantwogoodfriends:0 "Pole and Hungarian, Two Good Friends"
 HUN_poleandhungariantwogoodfriends_desc:0 "Pole and Hungarian - two good friends,\ngood for saber and for glass.\nBoth courageous, both lively,\nmay God bless them."
 HUN_lift_restrictions_on_minorities:0 "Lift Restrictions on Minorities"
 HUN_lift_restrictions_on_minorities_desc:0 "Previous governments have placed a number of restriction placed on minority groups in the country, limiting their economic and educational advancement. Lifting these restriction would incur severe backlash, but those minorities might be exactly what we need in these dark times."
 HUN_allow_german_military_access:0 "Offer Military Access to Germany"
 HUN_allow_german_military_access_desc:0 "Germany has clear strategic designs on our land, and trying to remain non-aligned while directly bordering Germany could lead to war. Surrendering our sovereignty like this would be extremely unpopular, but it may also be our last chance to preserve any semblance of independence."
 HUN_the_rise_of_germany:0 "The Rise of Germany"
 HUN_the_rise_of_germany_desc:0 "It is clear that Germany will be the cause of the next World War. Germany is the single greatest threat to Hungarian sovereignty right now, and even if the war has not yet reached our borders, we should take a proactive stance in opposing Germany so that we are not alone when [GER.GetLeader]'s ambitions turn to us."
 HUN_demand_southern_slovakia:0 "Demand Southern Slovakia"
 HUN_demand_southern_slovakia_desc:0 "Southern Slovakia is unique among the lands ceded at Trianon due to the fact that it is overwhelmingly Hungarian and also directly on the border. Even the great powers were reluctant to grant this demand to Czechoslovakia! Why should it remain in Czechoslovak hands when it is obviously rightful Hungarian territory?"
 HUN_demand_vojvodina:0 "Demand Vojvodina"
 HUN_demand_vojvodina_desc:0 "Vojvodina has a large concentration of Hungarians who are unduly oppressed under Yugoslav rule. Controlling this land is largely a matter of national prestige, but having a border guarded by the Danube to the south would also be strategically desirable."
 HUN_protect_the_ruthenians:0 "Protect the Ruthenians"
 HUN_protect_the_ruthenians_desc:0 "When Carpathia was given to Czechoslovakia at Trianon, it was on the condition that the Ruthenians be given autonomy. Needless to say, this has not happened, and Carpathia has always had stronger economic links to Hungary; therefore, the Ruthenians are better off in Hungary."
 HUN_demand_transylvania:0 "Demand Transylvania"
 HUN_demand_transylvania_desc:0 "The single greatest injustice forced upon us at Trianon was the cession of our core territory of Transylvania. Not only was its cession nonsensical from an ethnic perspective, the fact that Transylvania was a reward for Romania's poor military performance is both asinine and incomprehensible, and Transylvania must be retaken as soon as is expedient."
 HUN_the_true_enemy:0 "Vote of No Confidence"
 HUN_the_true_enemy_desc:0 "$HUN_kalman_daranyi_new$ has sent Hungary down a path of destruction. Despite his supposed pro-[ENG.GetAdjective] attitudes, he has in fact brought us towards [GER.GetLeader]'s unacceptable policies. We will bring down Imrédy's government and allies, replacing them with more reliable politicians."
 HUN_promote_hungarianism:0 "Protect Polish Exiles"
 HUN_promote_hungarianism_desc:0 "Our brother state, [POL.GetName], is at war, so we cannot stand by idly and do nothing. Though we cannot intervene directly to aid the Poles, we can still aid them by granting refuge to their retreating armies."
 HUN_danubian_federation:0 "Danubian Federation"
 HUN_danubian_federation_desc:0 "Although creating an independent Greater Hungary is very popular among the populace, there is an alternate option with support among the great powers and the political elite alike: a Danubian Federation. By uniting the states along the Danube, we will create a superpower that can defeat Germany and the Soviet Union, and we can take back our lands in the process."
 HUN_preserve_greater_hungary:0 "Preserve Greater Hungary"
 HUN_preserve_greater_hungary_desc:0 "Now that we have created a Greater Hungary, we should turn towards preserving what we have. We will lose all that we have gained if we do not subvert every state, ally or otherwise, which seeks to infringe upon our values."
 HUN_oppose_the_regency:0 "Oppose the Regency"
 HUN_oppose_the_regency_desc:0 "Horthy is an old man with outdated ideals. He has led Hungary down a destructive path and if nobody else wishes to stop him, then we will."
 HUN_allow_political_opposition:0 "Cooperate With the Hungarian Front"
 HUN_allow_political_opposition_desc:0 "The situation has deteriorated to the point that we may not be able to subvert foreign overlordship by ourselves. Our best ally in this fight may be the Hungarian Front, a coalition of anti-fascist parties, which also does not wish to see Hungary subjugated by foreign powers."
 HUN_overthrow_horthy:0 "Overthrow Horthy"
 HUN_overthrow_horthy_desc:0 "It may not be the most elegant solution, but violently removing Horthy from power is likely the most straightforward way to seize power. However, his popularity among the army may make a rebellion challenging unless we have foreign support."
 HUN_seizecontrolofhungarysfuture:0 "Seize Our Future"
 HUN_seizecontrolofhungarysfuture_desc:0 "Our preparations, clandestine or otherwise, have come to a climax. Hungary is a nation of proud and independent peoples, and we cannot chafe under foreign rule for any longer! It is time to rise up and seize our future!"
 HUN_a_pure_hungary:0 "A Pure Hungary"
 HUN_a_pure_hungary_desc:0 "Previous governments made the mistake of tolerating the existence of undesirable elements in our glorious country. Political enemies and subversive minorities alike must be forcibly dealt with before Hungary can truly be purified and reborn as the great country it was always meant to be."
 HUN_maintain_hungarian_sovereignty:0 "Mobilise the Royal Gendarmerie"
 HUN_maintain_hungarian_sovereignty_desc:0 "Hungary has essentially become a puppet state to her so-called \"allies.\" We may not be able to openly subvert foreign dominance yet, but by reasserting our control over the government and the Royal Gendarmerie, one of the few loyal military forces remaining, we still have a chance of surviving this war."
 HUN_request_foreign_support:0 "Request Foreign Support"
 HUN_request_foreign_support_desc:0 "Though humiliating, we may need foreign support for our operations. We are very likely to find a receptive ear in the great powers, and their support will greatly benefit our preparations."
 HUN_assassinate_horthy:0 "Assassinate Horthy"
 HUN_assassinate_horthy_desc:0 "Assassinating Horthy may be our best option for seizing power. With proper preparations, our forces can immediately move in to secure control of the country before the army can react. The only problems are whether the army will blindly accept such a result and whether the people will remain silent after the fact..."
 HUN_the_peace_party:0 "The $HUN_peace_party_long$"
 HUN_the_peace_party_desc:0 "Thanks to Horthy and the White Terror, we have vanishingly little support among the population. It may benefit us to temporarily rebrand ourselves as the $HUN_peace_party_long$ and infiltrate other parties, biding our time until we can seize power."
 HUN_recruit_the_poor:0 "Recruit the Poor"
 HUN_recruit_the_poor_desc:0 "The pitiful electoral results of the $HUN_democratic_party_long$ have greatly contributed to the radicalisation of the poor. Without a legal way to express their discontent, it would be very simple to convince the poor to join our party and support us in any future uprising..."
 HUN_expand_public_support:0 "Expand Public Support"
 HUN_expand_public_support_desc:0 "Our movement may have been pushed underground, but in these desperate times we can operate much more brazenly without fear of retribution. When the people see how much better Hungary would be under our rule, Horthy's grasp on the government will be weakened significantly."
 HUN_peace_overtures:0 "Peace Overtures"
 HUN_peace_overtures_desc:0 "We were dragged into this war against our will, and our enemies surely understand this. If we appeal to them for peace, we may actually be able to achieve it - assuming that our \"allies\" do not intervene to end our sovereignty."
 HUN_a_new_republic_of_councils:0 "A New Republic of Councils"
 HUN_a_new_republic_of_councils_desc:0 "Béla Kun established the ill-fated Hungarian Republic of Councils in 1919, and his execution was highly suspect. Warring with everyone around him, relying on aid that never came, alienating his only allies - we will avoid Kun's shortcomings and establish the communist state that Kun failed to create."
 HUN_abolish_the_monarchy:0 "Abolish the Monarchy"
 HUN_abolish_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Now that we have seized power, we should abolish the last remnant of the old regime. Hungary has no need for kings and regents; all she needs is us, and we will create the perfect society that the Hungarian people deserve."
 HUN_a_new_constitution:0 "A True Constitution"
 HUN_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "Hungary has never had a written constitution. Now that we are at peace, we can look towards rebuilding the country, starting with the political system."
 HUN_seek_support_from_the_west:0 "Seek Support from the West"
 HUN_seek_support_from_the_west_desc:0 "Interestingly, most of the support for a Danubian state comes from the great powers of the West. The British and the Americans are anxious to keep our lands out of German and Soviet control, and are likely to lend some form of support to us if we approach them with this proposal."
 HUN_invite_austria:0 "Invite Austria"
 HUN_invite_austria_desc:0 "Austria and Hungary have been tied together for centuries. The first proposal for a Danubian state came from Austria, and now we are in a position to make the proposal ourselves."
 HUN_the_benefactors_of_trianon:0 "The Benefactors of Trianon"
 HUN_the_benefactors_of_trianon_desc:0 "We have hated each other for far too long. Under a Danubian state, we would not have to worry about territorial ambitions or minority rights, as everyone would be protected equally. This is therefore the ideal solution for the conflict between our nations."
 HUN_invite_bulgaria:0 "Invite Bulgaria"
 HUN_invite_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria is the state that is most like our own; the Bulgarians also have unresolved territorial ambitions and are constantly under the spectre of the Soviet Union, and would likely join our project without many reservations."
 HUN_protect_our_sovereignty:0 "Protect Our Sovereignty"
 HUN_protect_our_sovereignty_desc:0 "We have been trapped between the great powers for far too long! Either they will abandon their pretences against us, or we will destroy them with our combined might!"
 HUN_asoldierofmikloshorthy:0 "A Soldier of Miklós Horthy"
 HUN_asoldierofmikloshorthy_desc:0 "After the communist revolution of 1919, Horthy took command of an army in order to restore order to Hungary. At the time, it seemed like he would never personally lead a military unit into action again. Circumstances have changed, but our allegiances have not: we are all soldiers of Horthy, and we will die for him to save Hungary."
 HUN_a_new_age_for_hungary:0 "A New Age for Hungary"
 HUN_a_new_age_for_hungary_desc:0 "We are free! After a grueling war, we have finally come out independent. We have surpassed the trials of the past thirty years and defeated even the great powers. Though the country may still be in disarray, we can deal with that later; for now, we should celebrate this new age for Hungary."
 HUN_call_for_elections:0 "Call for Elections"
 HUN_call_for_elections_desc:0 "We have enough support among the people to demand and contest elections now. If we cannot win enough seats, then we will pretend to form a grand coalition with the liberals, then find some creative ways to get rid of them and seize total control of the country."
 HUN_towards_danubian_integration:0 "Towards Danubian Integration"
 HUN_towards_danubian_integration_desc:0 "Equality is the greatest principle of our federation. Austria-Hungary fell apart because the Slavs and the other ethnic groups felt oppressed, and we will not repeat this mistake. We must bring everyone together and end our mutual enmity if we are to survive the trials ahead."
 HUN_the_mouth_of_the_danube:0 "The Mouth of the Danube"
 HUN_the_mouth_of_the_danube_desc:0 "Disuniting Germany has historically been a popular solution to the constant threat that Germany presents, and we have an excellent method of doing so. Bavaria and Wurtemburg were essentially forced into Germany, and would therefore be excellent additions to our Danubian state."
 HUN_telekis_dream:0 "Teleki's Dream"
 HUN_telekis_dream_desc:0 "Pál Teleki's greatest dream was to unite Hungary with the other Danubian states to create a powerful federation that would not be cowed by Germany and the Soviet Union. We have achieved his dream, and we will maintain it. After all, if we stand together, who will stand against us?"
 HUN_begin_land_reform:0 "Land Reforms"
 HUN_begin_land_reform_desc:0 "The single greatest problem facing the peasantry is the unequal distribution of land in the country. With our control over the government, we can now equitably redistribute the land, ending the dominance of the aristocracy in the process. This will be a massive political shift, but it must be done for the sake of the people."
 HUN_control_ministry_interior:0 "Control the Ministry of the Interior"
 HUN_control_ministry_interior_desc:0 "The powerful Ministry of the Interior controls the police and is responsible for eliminating subversive elements. We will demand control of this ministry and use it to purge our coalition partners, cutting them off like slices of salami."
 HUN_impose_martial_law:0 "Impose Martial Law"
 HUN_impose_martial_law_desc:0 "After being ruled for years by an anti-fascist government, the people have been brainwashed into opposing us at every turn. We will kindly convince them to support us at gunpoint and execute those who remain unrepentant."
 HUN_conscript_everyone:0 "Conscript Everyone"
 HUN_conscript_everyone_desc:0 "Everyone must contribute to the construction of the new Hungary, regardless of age. We will conscript every man who can hold a gun into the army, and they will gladly die for the future of our country."
 HUN_restore_historic_hungary:0 "Restore Historic Hungary"
 HUN_restore_historic_hungary_desc:0 "Merely achieving a Greater Hungary is not enough. Hungarians once controlled and terrorised the entire Carpathian basin - why would we be unable to do the same?"
 HUN_connationalism:0 "Connationalism"
 HUN_connationalism_desc:0 "Connationalism is a peculiarity of Szálasi's ideology and describes a world where pure nation-states dominate their historic homelands while living in harmony with each other. We should begin to implement our vision, starting with the territories that were once under our protection."
 HUN_hungarian_turanism:0 "Turanism"
 HUN_hungarian_turanism_desc:0 "The Hungarians migrated to the Carpathian basin from the Urals, mixing and allying with Turkic peoples along the way. Our culture is like no other in Europe, which gives us the opportunity to make allies across Eurasia in regions otherwise ignored by the great powers."
 HUN_four_cardinal_directions:0 "Four Cardinal Directions"
 HUN_four_cardinal_directions_desc:0 "The arrow cross represents our desire to expand in all four cardinal directions, in order to reach and surpass the heights of Historic Hungary. Furthermore, it represents our desire to become the centre of the entire world, with our unique origin bridging the East and the West. Hungary is the country best placed to remake the world, and we will make it happen by force."
 HUN_goulash_communism:0 "Goulash Communism"
 HUN_goulash_communism_desc:0 "Hungary is not an industrial society. Most of our economy is based on agriculture, our economy is devastated, and we have no way to create a socialist economy at the moment. Instead of taking drastic measures, we should begin with slow reforms and avoid harming the people we were meant to protect."
 HUN_struggle_fascism_reaction:0 "Struggle Against Fascism and Reaction"
 HUN_struggle_fascism_reaction_desc:0 "The [HUN.GetCommunistParty] is full of revisionists due to our long time in exile. If we are ever to achieve true communism, we must purge these people so that we may proceed with our industrialisation programme."
 HUN_new_economic_mechanism:0 "New Economic Mechanism"
 HUN_new_economic_mechanism_desc:0 "Rather than pursue radical industrialisation policies, we should implement a policy that favours the interests of producers. By setting flexible price controls, guaranteeing workers' rights, encouraging foreign trade, and decentralising economic planning, we may reap the productive benefits of market capitalism while maintaining development towards true socialism."
 HUN_rapid_industrialisation:0 "Rapid Industrialisation"
 HUN_rapid_industrialisation_desc:0 "It is because Hungary is an agrarian society that we must rapidly industrialise. We must put people to work in the factories so that we can produce the equipment necessary for an expansion of heavy industry."
 HUN_collectivisation:0 "Collectivisation"
 HUN_collectivisation_desc:0 "We have already redistributed the land to the peasants, but this is not enough. Agricultural production will be greatly increased if we group the peasants into cooperatives, allowing them to support each other in fulfilling their quotas."
 HUN_arms_expansion:0 "Develop Heavy Industry"
 HUN_arms_expansion_desc:0 "Now that we have the industry necessary to do so, we must expand our heavy industry and arms production. Consumer goods production is not important; we are faced with a massive war beyond any that has ever been seen before, and we must be ready to protect the advances of the workers."
 HUN_limited_liberalisation:0 "Limited Liberalisation"
 HUN_limited_liberalisation_desc:0 "The New Economic Mechanism has been an astounding success thus far. To expand this, we should secure foreign loans and investment in order to finally reach the productive stage necessary for a transition to true socialism."
 HUN_consolidation_of_socialism:0 "Foundations of a Socialist Society"
 HUN_consolidation_of_socialism_desc:0 "It is finally done. Thanks to our guidance, Hungary has advanced from an agrarian society to an undoubtedly industrial society. We have achieved the foundations for the establishment of a socialist society, meaning that the workers and peasants have truly triumphed at last, and we are ready for the final transition into communism."
 HUN_movement_soul:0 "The Movement Is the Soul"
 HUN_movement_soul_desc:0 "We wish to purify Hungary's soul. Hungary is a land of conquerors and farmers, not merchants. Hungary is the nation of the Hungarians, and nobody else. Those who are compatible with our society must assimilate, and those who are not must leave."
 HUN_party_body:0 "The Party Is the Body"
 HUN_party_body_desc:0 "We believe in Hungary for the Hungarians. It is the farmers and labourers of Hungary who inherit her spirit, and it is they who are best positioned to defend her soul."
 HUN_awaken_hungarian:0 "Awaken, Hungarian!"
 HUN_awaken_hungarian_desc:0 "Hungarians are the only peoples in all of Europe who migrated and conquered their way here from the Urals. We have terrorised the Carpathian basin for centuries and dominated Central Europe for just as long. If all Hungarians united, we would become an unstoppable force, and it is our destiny to do so."
 HUN_strengthen_the_monarchists:0 "Strengthen the Monarchists"
 HUN_strengthen_the_monarchists_desc:0 "The first step in returning Hungary to its previous prestige is to strengthen those parties that clamor for a return to a monarchy."
 HUN_elect_a_king:0 "Elect a King"
 HUN_elect_a_king_desc:0 "Popular support for the nation to return to a monarchy government form is now sufficient that we can begin to think about initiating the process of electing a new King."
 HUN_invite_the_habsburg_prince:0 "Elect Otto von Habsburg"
 HUN_invite_the_habsburg_prince_desc:1 "Long have the Habsburgs ruled Hungary, and under their rule the country was a part of one of Europe's greatest empires. Returning a Habsburg to the helm will surely lead Hungary to greatness once more."
 HUN_proclaim_the_restoration_of_austria_hungary:0 "Restoration of Austria-Hungary"
 HUN_proclaim_the_restoration_of_austria_hungary_desc:0 "With the reunification of our two nations and a Habsburg on the throne, we can now solemnly proclaim the restoration of Austria-Hungary, and see to expanding our influence!"
 HUN_elect_a_democratic_king:0 "Elect Carl Wilhelm"
 HUN_elect_a_democratic_king_desc:0 "We must seek a King who will uphold the democratic principles of our nation and the rights of our people."
 HUN_responsible_government:0 "Responsible Government"
 HUN_responsible_government_desc:1 "Traditionally, the government has ultimately answered to the king, allowing it to ignore the will of the people. We will change the constitution to ensure that it is the people, and not the ruler, who holds the government responsible."
 HUN_rapproachement_with_little_entente:0 "Rapprochement With Little Entente"
 HUN_rapproachement_with_little_entente_desc:0 "Hostile ideologies surround us, and we must re-affirm our ties to our Little Entente neighbours. We will ask them if they wish to see us rearm."
 HUN_the_balkan_pact:0 "The Balkan Pact"
 HUN_the_balkan_pact_desc:0 "The democracies of the West are too far away to aid us, and so we must seek allies closer to home. As the leader of the Balkan Pact, we will offer them our protection and lead them to victory!"
 HUN_an_unlikely_alliance:0 "An Unlikely Alliance"
 HUN_an_unlikely_alliance_desc:0 "We have changed our country fundamentally. We are no longer the war mongers of old. The time has come to reach out to our old enemies and forge a new destiny - together."
 HUN_elect_a_fascist_king:0 "Elect Lord Rothermere"
 HUN_elect_a_fascist_king_desc:0 "Our nation needs a powerful leader to steer it through the coming turbulent years. Our ruler must be one that the people can look up to, and our enemies can fear."
 HUN_joint_oil_exploitation_company:0 "Joint Oil Exploitation Company"
 HUN_joint_oil_exploitation_company_desc:0 "With the prospect of possible oil fields in our territory, we have attracted foreign attention. Friendly powers are eager to support our oil industry with their technical know-how, and this would be a lucrative opportunity to learn from their advances."
 HUN_restore_ottos_throne:0 "Otto of Austria"
 HUN_restore_ottos_throne_desc:0 "Although we have placed Otto on our throne, he is an Austrian at heart and support for his restoration in Austria is very strong. It may lead to another civil war, but there are no other leaders strong enough to resist German expansion."
 HUN_press_historic_claims:0 "Press Historic Claims"
 HUN_press_historic_claims_desc:0 "Otto does not understand the situation he is in. We are in a position to restore his entire empire, but he insists on protecting the lesser states of Europe! We will marginalise Otto in our government and use his name to expand our empire, regardless of his objections."
 HUN_bulwark_against_radicalism:0 "Bulwark Against Radicalism"

 HUN_support_paneuropean_union_desc:0 "Otto has always been a strong supporter of European unity, and we are in a position to put his plans into motion. We will begin by supporting the $HUN_PANEUROPA_FACTION$, a powerful organisation with branches across all of Europe."
 HUN_guardian_of_central_europe:0 "Guardian of Central Europe"
 HUN_guardian_of_central_europe_desc:0 "Our neighbours may not like us much, but we must stand together in these dangerous times. We will offer to join an alliance with them for our mutual benefit, and hopefully they will understand that it is in their best interests as well."

 HUN_from_the_atlantic_to_the_urals_desc:0 "Yes, it is Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, it is Europe, it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the fate of the world."
 HUN_fortify_our_borders:0 "Fortify Our Borders"
 HUN_fortify_our_borders_desc:0 "We will not be the ones to start the next war. It will be, without question, the great powers which surround us. Therefore, we must prepare to defend ourselves so that we can defeat the aggressors."
 HUN_alliance_with_poland:0 "Formalise the Friendship"
 HUN_alliance_with_poland_desc:0 "Pole and Hungarian - two good friends,\ngood for saber and for glass.\nBoth courageous, both lively,\nmay God bless them."
 HUN_confrontation_with_germany:0 "Confrontation With [GER.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_confrontation_with_germany_desc:0 "When the [GER.GetRulingParty] seized power, significant elements of the population protested and were violently repressed. We will support liberals in Germany, starting a German Revolution to restore democracy."
 HUN_dismantle_the_soviet_union:0 "Dismantle [SOV.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_dismantle_the_soviet_union_desc:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is an empire made of multiple disloyal nationalities, many of whom we are in a position to protect. We will liberate them and restore democracy where possible, destroying the [SOV.GetAdjective] spectre once and for all."
 HUN_in_defence_democracy:0 "For Homeland and Freedom"
 HUN_in_defence_democracy_desc:0 "Ferenc II Rákóczi led one of the greatest Hungarian national revolts, and his words remain with us even now. In the name of God, for homeland and freedom! Now that we are free, we must consolidate our strength so that we may protect ourselves and our allies from oppression."
 HUN_support_german_claims:0 "Support German Claims"
 HUN_support_german_claims_desc:0 "[GER.GetLeader]'s ambitions largely align with ours, and we should join their efforts to revise the injustices of the past and restore our former greatness."
 HUN_hungarys_place_in_the_sun:0 "Hungary's Place in the Sun"
 HUN_hungarys_place_in_the_sun_desc:0 "Lord Rothermere lost two sons in the war. They sacrificed their lives for noble ideas but not so that people would do so unjustly with a glorious nation. There won't be peace in Europe until the cunning and insensible Treaty of Trianon is revised."
 HUN_expand_corporatism:0 "Expand the Corporatist System"
 HUN_expand_corporatism_desc:0 "Under $HUN_gyula_gombos_de_jakfa$, Hungary established a basic corporatist system, although it was generally not very successful. We will expand this system and silence any opposition to it, ensuring that we have a free hand in improving the economy."
 HUN_intervene_in_mining:0 "Intervene in Mining Industries"
 HUN_intervene_in_mining_desc:0 "Hungary has significant resource deposits, and we should increase extraction of these resources to compensate for our lack of industry. This will help us raise funds for our economic project."
 HUN_use_the_minorities:0 "Force Minorities Into the Workforce"
 HUN_use_the_minorities_desc:0 "The great Hungarian people are doing everything they can to restore Hungary's glory, but what of everyone else? We will make use of their labour, regardless of whether they wish to or not, and thereby free Hungarian labourers to do more important work."
 HUN_glorious_hungary:0 "Glorious Hungary"
 HUN_glorious_hungary_desc:0 "Our project has succeeded. Hungary has been restored to its former glory, and there is nobody left who is capable of standing against us anymore. We will once again be the masters of the Carpathian basin."
 HUN_the_addams_family:0 "The Horthy Family"
 HUN_the_addams_family_desc:0 "Horthy's family, including his wife and sons, are powerful players in Hungarian society. It would be best to put them in positions of power to expand the influence of the regent."
 HUN_anglophile_policies:0 "Draw Closer to [ENG.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_anglophile_policies_desc:0 "Many powerful Hungarians are Anglophiles, and their influence puts us in a position to draw closer to [ENG.GetNameDef]. Despite our precarious situation, we may be able to find a receptive ear in the [ENG.GetAdjective] as long as we are genuine about our intentions."
 HUN_speak_out_fascism:0 "Openly Oppose Fascism"
 HUN_speak_out_fascism_desc:0 "Fascism is currently the most powerful threat to our way of life, and its supporters have made their way into the government. Even if it goes against democratic values, we must limit the fascists' influence so that we will not have to face such a dangerous threat to our society."
 HUN_elect_deputy_regent:0 "Elect a $deputy_regent2$"
 HUN_elect_deputy_regent_desc:0 "Horthy is growing old and cannot watch over Hungary forever. István is very popular among the people and would be an excellent successor, so we should create the position of $deputy_regent2$ to help him gain political experience."
 HUN_the_small_regent:0 "The Little Regent"
 HUN_the_small_regent_desc:0 "István's triumphant return has shifted the political landscape significantly; he is hailed as a champion of people and is now experienced enough to take on the mantle of national leadership. We will always be grateful to the regent for his service to our country, but it is time for Horthy to retire and leave Hungary's fate in his son's hands."
 HUN_the_emergency_bureau:0 "The Office for Bailing Out"
 HUN_the_emergency_bureau_desc:0 "If we wish to make any peace overtures, we will need to organise our diplomatic efforts. Additionally, we should place $HUN_miklos_horthy_jr$ in charge of this effort, as he is an experienced diplomat who may be able to sway our enemies to our side."
 HUN_bad_news_for_germany:0 "At the Mercy of the Sadists"
 HUN_bad_news_for_germany_desc:0 "Thousands, if not millions, across Europe chafe under terrible and sadistic rulers. Our armies must do everything they can to save them, since if we don't, then nobody else will."
 HUN_the_last_refuge:0 "Europe's Last Refuge"
 HUN_the_last_refuge_desc:0 "Hungary is the last refuge for Jews and central Europeans attempting to survive this terrible war. We will take them in, and some of them will certainly be willing to fight under our flag in order to liberate their homes."
 HUN_yugoslav_partisans:0 "Contact Yugoslav Partisans"
 HUN_yugoslav_partisans_desc:0 "Supporting Yugoslav partisans will distract the enemies around us while allowing us to gain a powerful ally. This will anger many, but not being able to survive this war will be much worse than any loss in national prestige."
 HUN_national_central_government:0 "National Central Government"
 HUN_national_central_government_desc:0 "A true democratic government compromises and cooperates with its opposition, and there may never be a more important time for cooperation than now. If the opposition will not work with us now, when Hungary's fate lies in the balance, then they are no Hungarians at all."
 HUN_we_will_pay:0 "The Price of Freedom"
 HUN_we_will_pay_desc:0 "We have fought and died in this war for far too long. We may have to fight our former \"allies\" to survive, but we are prepared to pay the price. We will come out of this war independent, no matter how much it costs us."
 HUN_build_the_arpad_line:0 "Build the Árpád Line"
 HUN_build_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "Hungary is beset by threats from every direction, but we should be particularly concerned about our eastern borders.

 HUN_mobilise_the_gendarmeries:0 "Mobilise the Royal Gendarmerie"

 HUN_proclaim_the_second_republic:0 "Proclaim the Second Republic"
 HUN_proclaim_the_second_republic_desc:0 "The Hungarian Republic is not remembered well, so we should not attempt to continue its legacy. Instead, we will create a new republic with a true constitution, and this time, we will not fail."
 HUN_look_outwards:0 "The $HUN_smallholders_party_long$"
 HUN_look_outwards_desc:0 "The $HUN_bethlen_peyer_pact$ dealt a crushing blow to the relevance of the $HUN_democratic_party_long$ from which the party has never truly recovered. Now, the greatest opposition coalition is the $HUN_smallholders_party_long$, and all those who wish to participate in politics must recognise and react to this new reality."
 HUN_support_mavag:0 "Expand MÁVAG's Operations"
 HUN_support_mavag_desc:0 "István is the director of MÁVAG, and is in a prime position to expand its operations. The company is mainly known for its locomotives, but the deteriorating world situation calls for different products - namely, motor vehicles and airplanes."
 HUN_rapproachement_with_little_entente:0 "Rapprochement With the Little Entente"
 HUN_contact_exiles:0 "Contact the Exiles"
 HUN_contact_exiles_desc:0 "We have sent away many of our most important politicians in order to build connections with the rest of the world. Now is the time to make use of those connections - with help from our allies abroad, we will be able to liberate Hungary from the spectre of radicalism."
 HUN_committee_liberation:0 "Convene the Committee of Liberation"
 HUN_committee_liberation_desc:0 "We will need a centralised body to coordinate our liberation efforts. If we can convince the leaders of the major political parties to join us, we will be able to operate more effectively on the home front while keeping our enemies paranoid at all times."
 HUN_limit_suspensive_veto:0 "Limit the Suspensive Veto"
 HUN_limit_suspensive_veto_desc:0 "The aristocracy remains the most powerful body in Hungary thanks to the suspensive veto, held by both the House of Magnates and the regent. If left unchecked, the power to paralyse the government for lengthy periods of time could be devastating during this terrible crisis."
 HUN_hungarian_independence_movement:0 "Support Independent Hungary"
 HUN_hungarian_independence_movement_desc:0 "$HUN_tibor_eckhardt$ is in contact with several sympathetic [USA.GetAdjective] politicians. Unlike our other potential allies, the [USA.GetAdjective]s tend to consider us a victim of circumstances, and we may be able to leverage this attitude to our favour."
 HUN_revoke_eckhardts_citizenship:0 "Revoke Eckhardt's Citizenship"
 HUN_revoke_eckhardts_citizenship_desc:0 "Our neighbours are already making thinly-veiled threats against us for our overtures to the [USA.GetAdjective]s. We may be able to protect $HUN_tibor_eckhardt$ and his allies by revoking his citizenship, thereby keeping his movement in the shadows, and a small \"donation\" from our treasury will ensure that the [USA.GetAdjective]s know our true intentions."
 HUN_hungarian_council:0 "Support the Hungarian Council"
 HUN_hungarian_council_desc:0 "To say that we are on bad terms with Mihály Károlyi, the disgraced president-in-exile, as well as most other Hungarian emigrants, is an understatement. However, his status among the Hungarian emigrants and his past as a political leader lends him some degree of legitimacy. If we put our differences aside, we may be able to save Hungary together."
 HUN_cooporate_ussr:0 "Cooperate With [SOV.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_cooporate_ussr_desc:0 "Mihály Károlyi is openly a socialist, but there are many who suspect him of being a communist. This could work in our favour - despite the differences between our regimes, there are some points of agreement between our and [SOV.GetAdjective] interests. Cooperating with the [SOV.GetAdjective]s could help us win over any stragglers who remain opposed to our cause."
 HUN_prepare_shadow_government:0 "Prepare a Shadow Government"
 HUN_prepare_shadow_government_desc:0 "We have solidified ties with our foreign allies, so we are now prepared for a more radical action. Hungary's geographical position is unfortunate, to say the least, and we must be able to continue running our government from a place of safety if our homeland falls to invasion."
 HUN_offer_hungarian_citizenship:0 "Hungarian Citizenship Act"
 HUN_offer_hungarian_citizenship_desc:0 "For diplomatic reasons, demanding our lands back would not be the best move right now. Instead, we should offer citizenship to Hungarians in other states, which would allow them to help build up our industry. Following this, we could either abandon our land claims or pursue them with our increased miitary strength."
 HUN_offer_land:0 "Offer Land to Migrants"
 HUN_offer_land_desc:0 "We lack the industry necessary to attract migrants with the promise of employment alone. Instead, we will buy lands from large landholders and sell them to migrants at a cheap cost. This would increase the flow of migrants greatly and could also lay the groundwork for further industrialisation."
 HUN_expand_the_arpad_line:0 "Expand the Árpád Line"
 HUN_expand_the_arpad_line_desc:0 "Our initial fortifications are useful, but they will not stop the [SOV.GetAdjective] hordes indefinitely. We will build bunkers, traps, and depots anywhere they can realistically be hidden, creating a truly unbreachable defensive line that will prevent any foreign power from successfully invading Hungary again."
 HUN_movement_of_hungarian_life:0 "The Movement of Hungarian Life"
 HUN_movement_of_hungarian_life_desc:0 "The rise of fascism in Hungary is concerning, so we must pre-empt the fascists by creating our own right-wing movement. Afterwards, we can suppress $HUN_ferenc_szalasi$ and his ilk, ensuring that we can maintain complete control over Hungary and any potential drift towards the right..."
 HUN_subvert_germany:0 "Subvert Foreign Control"
 HUN_subvert_germany_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we had to resort to desperate measures in order to take control of the government. For a proud state, this is unacceptable. We will assert our sovereignty wherever possible, eventually taking total control of our domestic and foreign affairs."
 HUN_demand_loyalty:0 "Demand Oaths of Loyalty"
 HUN_demand_loyalty_desc:0 "The $HUN_army_side$ has been acting increasingly independently of the $HUN_crown_side$, which is unacceptable. The army answers to Horthy, and Horthy alone. Taking orders from foreign overlords or otherwise is nothing less than treason."
 HUN_arrest_szalasi:0 "Arrest Szálasi"
 HUN_arrest_szalasi_desc:0 "$HUN_ferenc_szalasi$ is a major threat to our regime. Not only has his movement plotted against our regime, but also he is a traitor who would willingly betray his homeland for power. We must arrest him and force the $HUN_arrow_cross_party$ underground, hopefully forever."
 HUN_impose_censorship:0 "Restrict Civic Freedoms"
 HUN_impose_censorship_desc:0 "There is no room for dissent in our politics. If we do not stand united, then we will never be able to defeat the numerically and materially superior benefactors of Trianon. Those who oppose us will have their freedoms curtailed or imprisoned, regardless of their intentions."
 HUN_pivot_towards_germany:0 "Draw Closer to [GER.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_pivot_towards_germany_desc:0 "Our traditional allies have failed us, leaving us diplomatically isolated. If we are ever to correct the injustices of Trianon, we have no choice but to pivot towards Germany. [GER.GetLeader] may be the only one remaining who understands our plight..."
 HUN_christian_socialism:0 "Christian Socialism"
 HUN_christian_socialism_desc:0 "By expanding welfare programmes, we can not only improve the economy, but also limit the influence of radical groups. This will be expensive, but it is a much more subtle method of fighting radicalism than outright confrontation."
 HUN_look_outwards_real:0 "Look Outwards"
 HUN_look_outwards_real_desc:0 "Despite attempting to maintain non-belligerence, it is likely impossible to stay out of the coming war entirely. If we are ever to reverse the humiliations of Trianon, then we must capitalise on our newfound diplomatic opportunities and seek allies who will support our cause."
 HUN_commit_to_war:0 "Commit to the War Effort"
 HUN_commit_to_war_desc:0 "We have made our choice. Our future lies with [GER.GetNameDef] and any attempt at pretending otherwise will only arouse the suspicions of our allies. Thus, we should commit fully to the war effort in the hopes that our devotion will be rewarded."
 HUN_claims_on_galicia:0 "Claim Galicia"
 HUN_claims_on_galicia_desc:0 "Galicia has never been part of Hungary, but it is an important region which we can reasonably contest from the Carpathians, if only to help shield our Polish brothers from the war outside."
 HUN_request_croatia:0 "Claim Croatia"
 HUN_request_croatia_desc:0 "Croatia has been claimed by many opposing states, but our claim, based on historic control for hundreds of years, is the most credible. It is only right that we take control of it."
 HUN_request_transylvania:0 "Unite Transylvania"
 HUN_request_transylvania_desc:0 "Although we control Szekelyland, all of Transylvania is historic Hungarian territory and critical to our identity as a state. As long as this issue remains unsettled, we will never be satisfied with our territorial expansion."
