 gamer_horthy.1.desc:0 "$HUN_gyula_gombos_de_jakfa$, a former army officer, has been the Prime Minister of Hungary since 1932. However, he had been fighting cancer for a very long time, and has finally lost. An ambitious man, Gömbös sought foreign support to improve the economy during the Great Depression and to revise the Treaty of Trianon. Unfortunately, he will not be able to see his dreams come to fruition, and it will be up to us to carry on his work."
 gamer_horthy.1.a:0 "Rest in peace."
 gamer_horthy.2.t:0 "$HUN_look_outwards_real$"
 gamer_horthy.2.desc:0 "The world order is on the verge of collapse. Various reforms instituted over the years point towards this election being the most competitive in the entire history of Hungary. This is our last opportunity to change course and potentially seek new allies, if we so choose."
 gamer_horthy.2.a:0 "Radicalism will be the death of Hungary. We must stay vigilant."
 gamer_horthy.2.b:0 "We must empower the liberals, even if we must manipulate the voting rolls."
 gamer_horthy.2.c:0 "Let the radicals win. The establishment is too weak to save Hungary."

 gamer_horthy.3.desc:0 "During the Paris Peace Conference, we promised the Ruthenes autonomy in exchange for control of Carpathia. We have never upheld this promise, although this was not a problem until now. With [GER.GetNameDef] looming over us threateningly, the Ruthenes fear that we cannot protect them and thus demand additional instutional rights, just in case our state collapses."
 gamer_horthy.3.a:0 "At least they remain loyal..."
 gamer_horthy.3.b:0 "We cannot entertain potential separatists!"
 gamer_horthy.4.t:0 "Forging Foreign Ties"
 gamer_horthy.4.desc:0 "Our search for allies to help us reverse the injustice of Trianon may have come to an end. [?HUN.visitor_target.GetLeader] has invited [HUN.GetLeader] for a state visit, which could lead to an alliance in the future."
 gamer_horthy.4.a:0 "We need allies."
 gamer_horthy.4.b:0 "This is a dangerous idea."
 gamer_horthy.5.t:0 "Opera House Riots!"
 gamer_horthy.5.desc:0 "As [HUN.GetLeader] relaxed in the Budapest Opera House, supporters of $HUN_ferenc_szalasi$ rioted to demand his release, interrupting the show. This is an unprecedented escalation by the $HUN_arrow_cross_party_long$, and we must react quickly and decisively."
 gamer_horthy.5.a:0 "They need to be taught a lesson."
 gamer_horthy.5.b:0 "Let him out of prison."
 gamer_horthy.6.t:0 "$HUN_tibor_eckhardt_new$ Hanged"
 gamer_horthy.6.desc:0 "The occupation of [HUN.GetNameDef] featured little partisan activity, with the notable exception of $HUN_tibor_eckhardt_new$. A prominent radical and democrat, he was one of the few rebels who fought the [HUN.OVERLORD.GetAdjective] invaders, and he has been hanged for his actions."
 gamer_horthy.6.a:0 "How will this affect the $HUN_smallholders_party_long$?"
 gamer_horthy.7.t:0 "$HUN_tibor_eckhardt$ in Exile"
 gamer_horthy.7.desc:0 "Our continuing turn towards illiberalism has pushed $HUN_tibor_eckhardt$ out of the country and into exile. He has since moved to [USA.GetNameDef], but this has sparked protests from the [USA.GetAdjective]-[HUN.GetAdjective] Federation, which sees his actions as too little, too late."
 gamer_horthy.7.a:0 "This may be a problem?"
 gamer_horthy.8.t:0 "Rise of the $HUN_nazi_party_long$"
 gamer_horthy.8.desc:0 "After the collapse of the Scythe Cross Movement, some of the other fascist movements have attempted to unite. However, the grouping is unstable and already there are splinter movements - as of yet, the fascists do not pose a united threat to our government."
 gamer_horthy.8.a:0 "Their experiment will fail."
 gamer_horthy.9.desc:0 "It is no secret that [HUN.GetNameDef] occupies an extremely valuable crossroads in Central Europe. The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has therefore offered us military access to protect [HUN.GetName] from our territorial ambitions. Although [HUN.GetLeader] insists on remaining neutral, it is obvious that he has chosen to side with us out of fear."
 gamer_horthy.9.a:0 "Late is better than never."
 gamer_horthy.9.b:0 "We have a better idea."
 gamer_horthy.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.10.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted our offer of military access. The [From.GetAdjective]s will exercise significant control over our foreign affairs as a result of this agreement. This is incredibly unpopular among our people, and $HUN_pal_teleki$ has killed himself in response to this development."
 gamer_horthy.10.a:0 "A large price to pay for survival."
 gamer_horthy.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.11.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer of military access. This likely means that the [From.GetAdjective]s do not see us as a valuable ally, and are instead intent on conquering us as they have conquered their neighbours."
 gamer_horthy.11.a:0 "We must be prepared for whatever comes."
 gamer_horthy.12.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Requests Our Support"
 gamer_horthy.12.desc:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has requested our support in revising the Treaty of Trianon. [HUN.GetLeader] claims that the cessions were unjust and asks that we pressure the beneficiaries to cede some of the land back."
 gamer_horthy.12.a:0 "Trianon was an injustice."
 gamer_horthy.12.b:0 "That Treaty was meant to be permanent."
 gamer_horthy.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.13.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our request for support. Their diplomats will pressure the Trianon beneficiaries to agree to the demands that we make in the future."
 gamer_horthy.13.a:0 "The correct choice."
 gamer_horthy.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.14.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request for support. The [From.GetAdjective]s urge us to exercise restraint and accept our treaty obligations peacefully."
 gamer_horthy.14.a:0 "If it was their land that was stolen, would they stand by and do nothing?"
 gamer_horthy.15.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Land!"
 gamer_horthy.15.desc:0 "We have received an urgent diplomatic note from the [HUN.GetAdjective] embassy demanding our land, or else they would go to war. The [HUN.GetAdjective]s have withdrawn all vital diplomatic staff and their forces have gathered at our border. It seems that this is no bluff."
 gamer_horthy.15.a:0 "It took a war to be free."
 gamer_horthy.15.b:0 "We can compromise on this."
 gamer_horthy.15.c:0 "This is not worth a war."
 gamer_horthy.16.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.16.desc:0 "We have succeeded! The border regions stolen from us at Trianon have been returned, and our troops have raised the Hungarian flag over the redeemed lands."
 gamer_horthy.16.a:0 "History is corrected."
 gamer_horthy.17.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.17.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has gathered troops at our border and refuses to discuss the matter further. It seems that the [From.GetAdjective]s mean to die for every inch of the land that they stole from us."
 gamer_horthy.17.a:0 "We were being courteous by asking."
 gamer_horthy.18.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Compromise"
 gamer_horthy.18.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede certain territories which contain large numbers of Hungarians. Having been reunited with our people, there is little reason to press the claims further."
 gamer_horthy.18.a:0 "Barely acceptable."
 gamer_horthy.19.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Treaty of Eternal Friendship"
 gamer_horthy.19.desc:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has surprisingly offered to guarantee our borders in exchange for military support. This means that they would drop their land claims on us, and would allow us to focus on other threats."
 gamer_horthy.19.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 gamer_horthy.19.b:0 "We will be fine without them."
 gamer_horthy.20.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.20.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted our request. The [From.GetAdjective]s believe that our intentions are genuine, and hope for our cooperation in foreign affairs in the future."
 gamer_horthy.20.a:0 "A step towards security."
 gamer_horthy.21.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.21.desc:0 "Citing our lack of respect for the Treaty of Trianon, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request. The [From.GetAdjective]s must believe that we are merely seeking to increase our own influence at the expense of the [From.GetAdjective]s'."
 gamer_horthy.21.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 gamer_horthy.22.t:0 "[HUN.GetAdjective] Opposition Requests Support"
 gamer_horthy.22.desc:0 "The situation in [HUN.GetNameDef] has deteriorated to the point that the political opposition is requesting our support in overthrowing the government. In exchange, the future [HUN.GetAdjective] government would align closely to our interests, but the opposition's success is not exactly certain."
 gamer_horthy.22.a:0 "A deal with the devil?"
 gamer_horthy.22.b:0 "They do not understand our interests."
 gamer_horthy.23.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.23.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to secretly send us military advisors and materiel to assist us in our preparations. With this support, we will certainly overthrow [Root.GetLeader]!"
 gamer_horthy.23.a:0 "We must succeed."
 gamer_horthy.24.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.24.desc:0 "Strangely, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to acknowledge our requests for support. It would seem that the [From.GetAdjective]s have other plans for our country..."

 gamer_horthy.27.desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the [From.GetAdjective] government has not responded kindly to our peace negotiations. [Root.GetLeader] has been summoned for an explanation and the [From.GetAdjective] army is making preparations to occupy our country. If we let this happen, we will become little more than a puppet state of [From.GetNameDef]."
 gamer_horthy.27.a:0 "We must act!"
 gamer_horthy.28.t:0 "The Occupation of [HUN.GetNameDef]"
 gamer_horthy.28.desc1:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] army has taken up positions across the country and blocked our army from advancing, claiming that we are a threat to their national sovereignty! As the [HUN.GetAdjective] government is openly opposing us, it seems that open war will soon break out between us and the [HUN.GetAdjective]s if we do nothing about this situation."
 gamer_horthy.28.desc2:0 "Our rapid advance across Hungary has left the [HUN.GetAdjective] government paralysed. As things stand, [HUN.GetNameDef] is little more than a subject state under our rule, although we cannot forcibly replace the old government right now given the war situation."
 gamer_horthy.28.a:0 "They will die for this!"
 gamer_horthy.28.b:0 "We can't afford a distraction right now."
 gamer_horthy.28.c:0 "Will they try this stunt again?"
 gamer_horthy.29.t:0 "[HUN.GetNameDefCap] Offers Peace"
 gamer_horthy.29.desc:0 "The [HUN.GetAdjective] government has sent an impassioned appeal to us, claiming that [HUN.GetNameDef] was forced into this war against its will and that there is no reason for us to remain at war."
 gamer_horthy.29.a:0 "This is not their war to fight."

 gamer_horthy.32.t:0 "Autonomy for Carpathia"
 gamer_horthy.32.desc:0 "When we seized Carpathia, we promised the inhabitants that they would have territorial autonomy. We are now in a position to make good on our promise, although we could continue occupying the land as a military region without much fear of rebellion."

 gamer_horthy.33.t:0 "The Fate of Hungary"
 gamer_horthy.33.desc1:0 "Our army took up positions across the country and blocked the [From.GetAdjective] army from advancing. However, it seems that the [From.GetAdjective] government is extremely furious about our act of resistance and open war may soon break out between us and the [From.GetAdjective]s."
 gamer_horthy.33.desc2:0 "Our army took up positions across the country and blocked the [From.GetAdjective] army from advancing. However, it seems that the [From.GetAdjective] government is not keen on making more enemies, and will merely try to keep a closer eye on us in the future."
 gamer_horthy.33.desc3:0 "The [From.GetAdjective]s' rapid advance across Hungary has left our government paralysed. As things stand, we are little more than subjects under [From.GetAdjective] rule, although they cannot forcibly replace our government right now given the war situation."

 gamer_horthy.34.t:0 "The Price of Victory"
 gamer_horthy.34.desc:0 "The price of [From.GetAdjective] support for our uprising was the loss of our national sovereignty. Unfortunately, we will have to subordinate our political decisions to a [From.GetAdjective] minister, but at least we have saved Hungary from Horthy."

 gamer_horthy.36.t:0 "The Habsburg Crisis!"
 gamer_horthy.36.desc:0 "Now that Otto von Habsburg has reclaimed his throne in Hungary, the question of placing Otto on our own throne dominates all political discussion. In fact, Habsburg restorationism has become so strong that we will certainly face another civil war after only two years of tenuous peace..."

 gamer_horthy.37.t:0 "The Habsburg Crisis?"
 gamer_horthy.37.desc:0 "With the restoration of Austria-Hungary, [HUN.GetAdjective] expansionism is now a legitimate concern.
