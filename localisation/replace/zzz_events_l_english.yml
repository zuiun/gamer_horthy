 gamer_horthy.1.t:0 "Gyula Gömbös Dies"
 gamer_horthy.1.desc:0 "Gyula Gömbös, a former army officer, has been the Prime Minister of Hungary since 1932. However, he had been fighting cancer for a very long time, and has finally lost. An ambitious man, Gömbös sought foreign support to improve the economy during the Great Depression and to revise the Treaty of Trianon. Unfortunately, he will not be able to see his dreams come to fruition, and it will be up to us to carry on his work."
 gamer_horthy.1.a:0 "Rest in peace."
 gamer_horthy.9.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers Military Access"
 gamer_horthy.9.desc:0 "It is no secret that [From.GetNameDef] occupies an extremely valuable crossroads in Central Europe. The [From.GetAdjective] government has therefore offered us military access to protect [From.GetName] from our territorial ambitions. Although [From.GetLeader] insists on remaining neutral, it is obvious that he has chosen to side with us out of fear."
 gamer_horthy.9.a:0 "Late is better than never."
 gamer_horthy.9.b:0 "We have a better idea."
 gamer_horthy.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.10.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted our offer of military access. The [From.GetAdjective]s will exercise significant control over our foreign affairs as a result of this agreement. This is incredibly unpopular among our people, and $HUN_pal_teleki$ has killed himself in response to this development."
 gamer_horthy.10.a:0 "A large price to pay for survival."
 gamer_horthy.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.11.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer of military access. This likely means that the [From.GetAdjective]s do not see us as a valuable ally, and are instead intent on conquering us as they have conquered their neighbours."
 gamer_horthy.11.a:0 "We must be prepared for whatever comes."
 gamer_horthy.12.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Requests Our Support"
 gamer_horthy.12.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has requested our support in revising the Treaty of Trianon. [From.GetLeader] claims that the cessions were unjust and asks that we pressure the beneficiaries to cede some of the land back."
 gamer_horthy.12.a:0 "Trianon was an injustice."
 gamer_horthy.12.b:0 "That Treaty was meant to be permanent."
 gamer_horthy.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.13.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our request for support. Their diplomats will pressure the Trianon beneficiaries to agree to the demands that we make in the future."
 gamer_horthy.13.a:0 "The correct choice."
 gamer_horthy.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.14.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request for support. The [From.GetAdjective]s urge us to exercise restraint and accept our treaty obligations peacefully."
 gamer_horthy.14.a:0 "If it was their land that was stolen, would they stand by and do nothing?"
 gamer_horthy.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Our Land!"
 gamer_horthy.15.desc:0 "We have received an urgent diplomatic note from the [From.GetAdjective] embassy demanding our land, or else they would go to war. The [From.GetAdjective]s have withdrawn all vital diplomatic staff and their forces have gathered at our border. It seems that this is no bluff."
 gamer_horthy.15.a:0 "It took a war to be free."
 gamer_horthy.15.b:0 "We can compromise on this."
 gamer_horthy.15.c:0 "This is not worth a war."
 gamer_horthy.16.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.16.desc:0 "We have succeeded! The border regions stolen from us at Trianon have been returned, and our troops have raised the Hungarian flag over the redeemed lands."
 gamer_horthy.16.a:0 "History is corrected."
 gamer_horthy.17.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.17.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has gathered troops at our border and refuses to discuss the matter further. It seems that the [From.GetAdjective]s mean to die for every inch of the land that they stole from us."
 gamer_horthy.17.a:0 "We were being courteous by asking."
 gamer_horthy.18.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Compromise"
 gamer_horthy.18.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede certain territories which contain large numbers of Hungarians. Having been reunited with our people, there is little reason to press the claims further."
 gamer_horthy.18.a:0 "Barely acceptable."
 gamer_horthy.19.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Treaty of Eternal Friendship"
 gamer_horthy.19.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has surprisingly offered to guarantee our borders in exchange for military support. This means that they would drop their land claims on us, and would allow us to focus on other threats."
 gamer_horthy.19.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 gamer_horthy.19.b:0 "We will be fine without them."
 gamer_horthy.20.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.20.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted our request. The [From.GetAdjective]s believe that our intentions are genuine, and hope for our cooperation in foreign affairs in the future."
 gamer_horthy.20.a:0 "A step towards security."
 gamer_horthy.21.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.21.desc:0 "Citing our lack of respect for the Treaty of Trianon, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request. The [From.GetAdjective]s must believe that we are merely seeking to increase our own influence at the expense of the [From.GetAdjective]s'."
 gamer_horthy.21.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 gamer_horthy.22.t:0 "[HUN.GetAdjective] Opposition Requests Support"
 gamer_horthy.22.desc:0 "The situation in [From.GetNameDef] has deteriorated to the point that the political opposition is requesting our support in overthrowing the government. In exchange, the future [From.GetAdjective] government would align closely to our interests, but the opposition's success is not exactly certain."
 gamer_horthy.22.a:0 "A deal with the devil?"
 gamer_horthy.22.b:0 "They do not understand our interests."
 gamer_horthy.23.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.23.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to secretly send us military advisors and materiel to assist us in our preparations. With this support, we will certainly overthrow [Root.GetLeader]!"
 gamer_horthy.23.a:0 "We must succeed."
 gamer_horthy.24.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.24.desc:0 "Strangely, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to acknowledge our requests for support. It would seem that the [From.GetAdjective]s have other plans for our country..."
 gamer_horthy.24.a:0 "Fine, we can do it without them!"
 gamer_horthy.25.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Opposition Victorious"
 gamer_horthy.25.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] has successfully overthrown the government. As agreed, we will send a minister to [From.GetNameDef] in order to ensure that our interests and policies are closely aligned."
 gamer_horthy.25.a:0 "Another country joins our sphere."
 gamer_horthy.26.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Seeks a Separate Peace"
 gamer_horthy.26.desc:0 "Our erstwhile \"ally,\" [From.GetNameDef], is making offers of peace to our enemies! They seek to abandon our war, and possibly even join our enemies in the process!"
 gamer_horthy.26.a:0 "[From.GetLeader] has gone too far!"
 gamer_horthy.27.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Is Preparing to Occupy [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 gamer_horthy.27.desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the [From.GetAdjective] government has not responded kindly to our peace negotiations. [Root.GetLeader] has been summoned for an explanation and the [From.GetAdjective] army is making preparations to occupy our country. If we let this happen, we will become little more than a puppet state of [From.GetNameDef]."
 gamer_horthy.27.a:0 "We must act!"
 gamer_horthy.28.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Resists Occupation"
 gamer_horthy.28.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] army has taken up positions across the country and blocked our army from advancing, claiming national sovereignty! The [From.GetAdjective] government is openly opposing our war effort, and it seems that open war will soon break out if we do not make a decision!"
 gamer_horthy.28.a:0 "They will die for this!"
 gamer_horthy.28.b:0 "We can't afford a distraction right now."
 gamer_horthy.29.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers Peace"
 gamer_horthy.29.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has sent an impassioned appeal to us, claiming that [From.GetNameDef] was forced into this war against its will and that there is no reason for us to remain at war."
 gamer_horthy.29.a:0 "This is not their war to fight."
 gamer_horthy.29.b:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] is a nation of cowards."
 gamer_horthy.30.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 gamer_horthy.30.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has accepted our appeal for peace. The [From.GetAdjective] army will respect our borders turn its attention to our former allies."
 gamer_horthy.30.a:0 "We are safe."
 gamer_horthy.31.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gamer_horthy.31.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government ahs refused our appeal for peace. The [From.GetAdjective]s state that there exists a war between us and them, and that it must be prosecuted to the end."
 gamer_horthy.31.a:0 "We don't stand a chance..."
 gamer_horthy.32.t:0 "Autonomy for Carpathia"
 gamer_horthy.32.desc:0 "When we seized Carpathia, we promised the inhabitants that they would have territorial autonomy. We are now in a position to make good on our promise, although we could continue occupying the land as a military region without much fear of rebellion."
 gamer_horthy.32.a:0 "Hungarians always honour their promises."
 gamer_horthy.32.b:0 "No, no, never!"
 gamer_horthy.33.t:0 "A Life for Hungary"
 gamer_horthy.33.desc:0 "Horthy has served Hungary faithfully for three decades, and it may now be time for him to retire. Since Hungary has never had a true constitution, we should begin this new age by restructuring our political system."
 gamer_horthy.33.a:0 "We remember the Twelve Points!"
 gamer_horthy.33.b:0 "We must protect our traditions."
 gamer_horthy.34.t:0 "Equality, liberty, brotherhood!"
 gamer_horthy.34.desc:0 "In establishing a democratic regime, we have two models to follow. Either we could establish a constitutional monarchy with a powerful parliament, much like our current system, or we could establish a republic instead, which would likely anger Horthy's supporters."
 gamer_horthy.34.a:0 "Crown Horthy as a constitutional monarch!"
 gamer_horthy.34.b:0 "Establish a republic!"
 gamer_horthy.35.t:0 "Our Traditions"
 gamer_horthy.35.desc:0 "Having chosen to retain the monarchy, we have a few options for our king. Either we could crown Horthy as our king, or we could choose someone else, most likely Otto von Habsburg."
 gamer_horthy.35.a:0 "Crown Horthy as our king!"
 gamer_horthy.35.b:0 "Perhaps we should elect someone else?"
 gamer_horthy.36.t:0 "The Habsburg Crisis!"
 gamer_horthy.36.desc:0 "Now that Otto von Habsburg has reclaimed his throne in Hungary, the question of placing Otto on our own throne dominates all political discussion. In fact, Otto's restoration has become so concerning that we will certainly face another civil war after only two years of tenuous peace..."
 gamer_horthy.36.a:0 "Otto is the only one who can save Austria from Germany..."
 gamer_horthy.36.b:0 "How many times do we have to depose the Habsburgs!?"
 gamer_horthy.37.t:0 "The Habsburg Crisis?"
 gamer_horthy.37.desc:0 "With the restoration of Austria-Hungary, [From.GetAdjective] expansionism is now a legitimate concern. Though the Little Entente was formed to contain Hungarian aggression, Otto is a known liberal and it is possible that he will seek rapprochement with us rather than pursue his claims."
 gamer_horthy.37.a:0 "If the situation develops unfavourably, then we will act."
 gamer_horthy.37.b:0 "The cost of war outweighs the price of peace."
 gamer_horthy.37.c:0 "The end of the Empire was a mistake, anyway."
 gamer_horthy.38.t:0 "The Habsburg Disaster!"
 gamer_horthy.38.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has essentially been overthrown, and the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to press the Habsburg claims against us. This is a valid cause for war, but the [From.GetAdjective] government is probably not stupid enough to go to war over those claims."
 gamer_horthy.38.a:0 "It is time to act!"
 gamer_horthy.38.b:0 "Would the [From.GetAdjective]s really go that far?"
 gamer_horthy.39.t:0 "The Second Austrian Civil War Is Over!"
 gamer_horthy.39.desc1:0 "With the end of the Second Austrian Civil War, [AUS.GetLeader] has offered the throne of Austria to [Root.GetLeader]. [AUS.GetLeader] will remain Chancellor, serving Austria as the representative of [Root.GetLeader]."
 gamer_horthy.39.desc2:0 "With the end of the Second Austrian Civil War, there is no possibility that [Root.GetLeader] can assume the throne of Austria peacefully. Our only option is to restore Otto's throne by force."
 gamer_horthy.39.a:0 "The hour of reunion between the Duke and the people has arrived."
 gamer_horthy.39.b:0 "The Austrian people have never cast a vote in favour of the republic."
 gamer_horthy.40.t:0 "Join the $HUN_eec3$?"
 gamer_horthy.40.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader]'s European integration project has advanced at an extremely quick pace. He has now formed a $HUN_eec3$, which is to be the precusor of a united Europe. If we join this union, we will be subordinating our national interests for European interests, but that may be exactly what we need in these troubling times."
 gamer_horthy.40.a:0 "Let Europe arise!"
 gamer_horthy.40.b:0 "Further integration would be dangerous."

 gamer_horthy.41.a:0 "Let Europe arise..."
 gamer_horthy.41.b:0 "They dare infringe upon our sovereignty!?"
 gamer_horthy.42.t:0 "Brothers No Longer"
 gamer_horthy.42.desc:0 "A state of war currently exists between [HUN.GetName] and [POL.GetName]. As a result, the brotherly ties that once existed between the two nations no longer play a meaningful role in diplomatic relations between the two states."
 gamer_horthy.42.a:0 "So be it."

Thought he was immediately rushed to the hospital, doctors announced that he was already deceased by the time he arrived. The gunman, shot by police as he tried to escape the scene, has been identified as a [From.GetRulingParty] member.\n\nThe assassination has caused an uproar in domestic Hungarian politics, as Horthy's anti-[From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] leanings were paramount in keeping subversive elements at bay. Without the old admiral at the helm of the political scene, it is likely that [From.GetRulingIdeologyNoun]s will be able to seize control of the country."

Today, amidst much fanfare and celebration, he was crowned King of Hungary in a solemn ceremony at the Royal Palace in Budapest.\n\nDuring his coronation speech King Otto thanked the Hungarian people for their loyalty and devotion, and vowed to see the Habsburg lands reunited once more, promising that this time Hungary would be truly equal to Austria."
